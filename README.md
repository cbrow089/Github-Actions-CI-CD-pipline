  ## Description
  * This is an application designed to test Github actions with Continuous Integrations and Continuous Deployment in mind.  This had provided starter code for a quiz application that was in need of testing and CI/CD pipeline considerations when merging from a develop branch into a main branch before deployment to a live URL on Render.

  ## Installation
  * This is installed using cypress and github actions creating a workflow process that has checks built into pull requests on github to ensure that broken code does not get pushed into a main branch or go live before it has been tested and passes those tests.
    
  ## Usage
  This application is used by creating github action files that simultaneously run component tests using cypress and then deploying the application to Render once the tests have passed and the develop branch has been successfully merged into the main branch.
